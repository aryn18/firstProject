x = 9
y = 4
# addition operator
print(x+y)

# subtraction operator
print(x-y)

# multiplication operator
print(x*y)

# division operator
print(x/y)

# division operator we get floor of a number ex 3.3 is 3 5.9 is 5 for negative is -3.2 is -4  and floor - 9.5 is -10.
print(x//y)

# modulo operator
print(x % y)

# power operator or exponent operator
print(x**y)

# example 2
a = -5
b = 2
print(a//b)
c = 5.0
d = 2
print(c//d)
e = 2
f = -2
print(e**f)

# precedence example
print(5+2*3)
print(5+3*4**2)

# associativity example
print(5+4-2)
print(2**2**-1)
print((2**2)**-1)
